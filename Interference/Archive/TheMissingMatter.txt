The nebula should have been bigger.  Where did all the matter go?  It wasn't even half the size it should have been.

Show me the readings from the last probe again.
Yeah, sure.  Puts the probe results on screen.
When are these from again?
Six-ish months ago, Earth Standard Time.
What the hell?  Are those probe images in the visible spectrum?
Yes.  Here's IR and UV.
So where did it go?
Is it uniform?
Is what?
the missing matter, is it all H?  or are the heavies missing too?
