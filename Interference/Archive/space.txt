There are 3 reasons to go to space:
1. You are running away from something
2. You are running towards something
3. You need something


You don't need to go to space to understanding the meaning of life.
Just study a leaf.  It is the small interactions that matter.
Large scale interactions can provide grandeur, but they can only provide the stage.
