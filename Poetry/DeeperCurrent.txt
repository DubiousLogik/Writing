The Deeper Current
------------------
The deeper current can be hard
to find.
Slipping under both rudder and oar
Feel yourself slide out
Adrift
In pools of nowhere
Eddies of both mayhem and sameness
Endlessly repeating
Illusions of purpose
Find nothing there but the familiar
Seek the deeper current

Eddies of both
